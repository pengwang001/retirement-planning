Retirement Benefits Calculation (Automatic)

Full Retirement Age (FRA): 67 for birth year ≥1960

Early claim (62): ~70–75% of FRA benefit

Late claim (70): ~124–132% of FRA benefit

FRA benefit estimation: ~40% of average annual income × adjustment for years worked

Spousal Rules:

If both working: calculate separately for each, then add.

If only one working: non-working spouse gets up to 50% of working spouse’s FRA benefit, adjusted for early claiming age. (Spousal benefit does not increase with delayed retirement.)

Add benefits as an income stream starting at the claim age in the retirement forecast.
